    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "> - *Tool Output*: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI in healthcare is incredibly dynamic, with new developments emerging almost daily. To give you the most up-to-date picture, I'll focus on some of the key trends and recent breakthroughs:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Advancements in Diagnostics and Imaging:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Improved Accuracy and Speed:** AI algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated at analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides) to detect diseases like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular conditions with remarkable accuracy, often matching or even surpassing human experts. Recent news highlights include AI's role in identifying subtle signs of Alzheimer's disease from brain scans and detecting early-stage lung nodules.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Treatment Planning:** AI is helping to analyze patient data, including genomic information and imaging results, to predict how a patient might respond to different treatments, leading to more personalized and effective care plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Discovery:** AI is significantly speeding up the process of identifying potential drug candidates by analyzing vast biological datasets, predicting molecular interactions, and simulating drug efficacy. Companies are reporting faster timelines for preclinical drug development.\n",
      "*   **Repurposing Existing Drugs:** AI is also proving effective in identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed for new diseases, a much faster and less expensive route than developing entirely new compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Predictive Analytics and Early Intervention:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Forecasting Disease Outbreaks:** AI models are being used to track and predict the spread of infectious diseases by analyzing various data sources, including social media trends, travel patterns, and public health records.\n",
      "*   **Identifying High-Risk Patients:** AI can analyze electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients at higher risk of developing certain conditions (e.g., sepsis, hospital readmission, adverse drug reactions), allowing for proactive interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Robotic Surgery and Assistance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Enhanced Precision:** AI is being integrated into robotic surgical systems to provide surgeons with greater precision, stability, and visualization during complex procedures. This can lead to less invasive surgeries and faster recovery times.\n",
      "*   **Surgical Planning and Guidance:** AI can assist in pre-operative planning by creating 3D models of patient anatomy and provide real-time guidance to surgeons during operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. AI-Powered Virtual Assistants and Chatbots:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Engagement and Support:** AI chatbots are being used for symptom checking, appointment scheduling, medication reminders, and providing health information, improving patient engagement and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals.\n",
      "*   **Mental Health Support:** AI-powered tools are emerging to offer initial mental health assessments and provide supportive interventions, especially in areas with limited access to mental health professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Challenges and Ethical Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Privacy and Security:** Protecting sensitive patient data used to train and operate AI systems remains a critical concern.\n",
      "*   **Bias in Algorithms:** Ensuring AI algorithms are fair and do not perpetuate existing healthcare disparities based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status is an ongoing area of research and development.\n",
      "*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** The approval and adoption of AI-powered medical devices and software are subject to rigorous regulatory processes.\n",
      "*   **Explainability and Trust:** Healthcare professionals and patients need to understand how AI makes decisions to build trust and ensure accountability.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze large datasets of drug-gene interactions, disease pathways, and clinical trial results to identify existing approved drugs that could be effective against new diseases. This is a much faster and cheaper route to new treatments, as safety profiles are already well-established.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** This has been particularly impactful in identifying potential treatments for rare diseases or even during pandemics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Advanced Data Integration and Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Multi-omics Integration:** AI excels at integrating and analyzing diverse biological datasets (genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, clinical, imaging) to gain a holistic understanding of disease mechanisms and drug responses.\n",
      "*   **Real-World Evidence (RWE):** AI can analyze RWE from electronic health records, insurance claims, and patient-generated data to understand drug performance in real-world settings, identify new indications, and optimize treatment regimens.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the \"second development\" I mentioned regarding drug discovery: **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical foundational step in the entire drug discovery pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a more detailed look at what this entails and why it's so important:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before AI, identifying a drug target was often a laborious process. Generally, a drug target is a specific molecule in the body that a drug is designed to interact with to produce a therapeutic effect. This molecule is typically a protein (like an enzyme or a receptor) that is involved in a disease process. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Enzymes:** A drug might inhibit an enzyme that produces a harmful substance.\n",
      "*   **Receptors:** A drug might block a receptor that triggers an unwanted signal or mimic a natural signal that's deficient.\n",
      "*   **Ion Channels:** A drug might modulate the flow of ions into or out of cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyzing Massive, Complex Biological Datasets:**\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** AI can analyze entire genomes (DNA sequences) to identify genes that are mutated or over/under-expressed in diseased cells compared to healthy ones. It can correlate specific genetic variations with disease risk or progression.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** AI can analyze the set of proteins present in a cell or tissue at a given time. This helps understand which proteins are actively involved in disease pathways and if their abundance or modification state changes.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics (RNA-Seq):** AI examines RNA levels, which indicate which genes are actively being transcribed into proteins. This provides a dynamic view of cellular activity and how it differs in disease.\n",
      "    *   **Epigenomics:** AI can look at modifications to DNA that don't change the underlying sequence but can affect gene activity.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Data (EHRs, patient registries):** AI can identify patterns in patient data that correlate with specific disease manifestations or responses to treatment, pointing towards underlying biological mechanisms and thus potential targets.\n",
      "    *   **Literature Mining:** AI can \"read\" and synthesize information from millions of scientific publications, identifying recurring themes, experimental findings, and hypotheses about disease mechanisms that humans might miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Uncovering Novel and Unexpected Targets:**\n",
      "    *   **Moving Beyond Known Pathways:** Traditional research often focuses on well-understood disease pathways. AI can explore vast biological spaces and identify entirely new, previously uncharacterized proteins or pathways that are crucial for disease development.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying \"Undruggable\" Targets (with caveats):** While some targets are notoriously hard to drug (e.g., certain protein-protein interactions), AI can help identify novel ways to modulate their activity or find related targets that are more accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n",
      "    *   **Is it Amenable to Drug Intervention?** Once a potential target is identified, a key question is whether it's possible to design a molecule that can bind to it effectively and safely. AI models can be trained to predict this \"druggability\" by analyzing the target's structure, its role in the cell, and comparing it to known targets that have been successfully drugged.\n",
      "    *   **Predicting Binding Pockets:** AI can help predict the specific three-dimensional sites on a target protein where a drug molecule could attach.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Validating Target Importance:**\n",
      "    *   **Confirmation:** AI doesn't just identify potential targets; it can help validate their significance. By analyzing how changes in the target's activity affect disease outcomes across different datasets, AI can provide strong evidence that this target is indeed a good candidate for therapeutic intervention.\n",
      "    *   **Ranking Targets:** In cases where multiple potential targets are found, AI can help prioritize them based on factors like their likelihood of success, potential for side effects, and uniqueness to the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this so crucial?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Foundation of Drug Discovery:** Without a good target, the entire drug discovery process is fundamentally flawed. Finding the *right* target is like finding the right lock to pick.\n",
      "*   **Reduces Risk and Cost:** Identifying and validating targets early on with AI can significantly reduce the number of failed drug candidates that proceed to expensive preclinical and clinical testing. It helps focus resources on the most promising avenues.\n",
      "*   **Opens New Therapeutic Avenues:** By uncovering novel targets, AI allows researchers to explore entirely new ways to treat diseases that have been intractable with existing approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples in Practice:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Companies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** use AI to analyze vast image datasets of cells treated with various genetic and chemical perturbations. They can then identify novel targets by observing how specific genes or molecules influence cellular phenotypes related to disease.\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine** uses AI to analyze multi-omics data from patient populations to uncover novel disease mechanisms and identify associated targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI-powered target identification and validation is like giving drug developers a highly sophisticated magnifying glass and an advanced detective's toolkit to systematically uncover the root causes of diseases at a molecular level, paving the way for truly innovative therapies.\n",
      "\n",

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",

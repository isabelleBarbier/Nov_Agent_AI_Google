    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "> - *Tool Output*: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and impactful areas for AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Beyond Screening:** Instead of just screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like GANs and variational autoencoders) are now *designing* entirely new molecules from scratch. These models can be trained on vast datasets of known drugs and biological targets to generate molecules with desired properties (e.g., high binding affinity, low toxicity, good oral bioavailability).\n",
      "*   **\"De Novo\" Design:** This \"de novo\" (from scratch) approach allows researchers to explore chemical spaces that might not have been considered previously, potentially leading to truly novel therapeutic agents.\n",
      "*   **Example:** Companies are using these tools to design small molecules for challenging targets, accelerate lead optimization, and even create peptides and proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. AI for Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling:** AI is significantly enhancing QSAR models, which predict how a drug's chemical structure relates to its biological activity. Deep learning models can capture more complex relationships than traditional methods.\n",
      "*   **ADMET Prediction:** Predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) is crucial for drug development. AI models are becoming more accurate at forecasting these properties early on, helping to weed out candidates with poor drug-like qualities before expensive lab testing.\n",
      "*   **Off-Target Effects Prediction:** AI can help predict potential unintended interactions of a drug with other biological targets, which can lead to side effects. This allows for earlier mitigation strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. AI in Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Genomics and Proteomics Integration:** AI can analyze vast amounts of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to identify novel disease-associated genes and proteins that could serve as drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Network Biology Analysis:** AI can map complex biological networks and identify critical nodes or pathways that, when modulated, could treat a disease.\n",
      "*   **Literature Mining:** LLMs are being used to rapidly sift through millions of scientific publications to identify emerging trends, potential targets, and existing knowledge gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. AI for Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Selection:** AI can identify patient subgroups most likely to respond to a particular treatment, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Trial Design:** AI can help optimize trial protocols, predict recruitment rates, and even identify potential risks or bottlenecks in trial execution.\n",
      "*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can analyze patient data to identify novel biomarkers that can predict treatment response or disease progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. AI in Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze existing drug databases and compare their molecular profiles and known effects with disease signatures to identify drugs that might be effective for new indications. This is a faster and cheaper route than developing entirely new drugs.\n",
      "*   **Example:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI was used to screen existing drugs for potential antiviral activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. AI for Biologics and Antibody Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Protein Engineering:** AI is being applied to design novel proteins and antibodies with improved therapeutic properties, such as enhanced binding affinity, stability, and reduced immunogenicity.\n",
      "*   **Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs):** AI can help design more effective ADCs by optimizing the antibody, linker, and payload for targeted delivery and efficacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies and Initiatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies are at the forefront of AI in drug discovery, including:\n",
      "\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned: **AI for Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy**. This is a really crucial area because it tackles one of the biggest bottlenecks and failure points in traditional drug discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break it down further:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is Predicting Drug Properties So Important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing a new drug involves more than just finding a molecule that *might* interact with a disease target. For a drug to be successful, it needs to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Be deliverable to the target:** It needs to be absorbed into the body (e.g., through the gut if it's an oral pill) and reach the site of action.\n",
      "*   **Stay in the body long enough to work:** It shouldn't be metabolized or excreted too quickly.\n",
      "*   **Not be toxic:** It should have minimal harmful side effects.\n",
      "*   **Effectively treat the disease:** It needs to have the desired biological effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, identifying these properties involves extensive, time-consuming, and expensive laboratory experiments. Many promising molecules fail at later stages because they have poor drug-like qualities. AI aims to predict these failures much earlier in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing This Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Enhanced Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modeling:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** QSAR models try to link a molecule's chemical structure to its biological activity. Think of it as finding mathematical relationships between how a molecule is built and how it behaves biologically.\n",
      "    *   **AI's contribution:** Traditional QSAR often relied on simpler statistical methods. Deep learning, a subset of AI, can analyze much more complex and non-linear relationships between molecular features (like atom types, bond arrangements, electronic properties) and their predicted activity. This leads to more accurate predictions, especially for novel chemical structures.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** An AI model could be trained on thousands of known compounds and their measured biological activities. When presented with a new molecule, it can predict its likely efficacy against a specific target based on patterns learned from the training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Predicting ADMET Properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity):**\n",
      "    *   **The Challenge:** These are complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes. For instance, predicting how well a drug is absorbed in the gut or how quickly it's broken down by liver enzymes requires understanding intricate biological mechanisms.\n",
      "    *   **AI's role:** AI models can be trained on vast datasets that include experimental ADMET data for many compounds. These models can then predict these properties for new, untested molecules.\n",
      "        *   **Absorption:** Will it get into the bloodstream?\n",
      "        *   **Distribution:** Where will it go in the body? Will it cross the blood-brain barrier?\n",
      "        *   **Metabolism:** How will the body break it down? Are the breakdown products safe?\n",
      "        *   **Excretion:** How will the body get rid of it?\n",
      "        *   **Toxicity:** What are the potential harmful effects?\n",
      "    *   **Impact:** By flagging molecules with poor ADMET profiles early, researchers can save significant resources and time by not pursuing them further. This drastically reduces the attrition rate (the percentage of drug candidates that fail).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Off-Target Effects and Drug-Target Interactions:**\n",
      "    *   **The Problem:** A drug might be designed to bind to a specific protein (the intended target) but can also bind to other, unintended proteins (off-targets). This binding can lead to unwanted side effects, sometimes severe.\n",
      "    *   **AI's Solution:** AI models can analyze the structural similarity between a drug molecule and known binders of various proteins. They can also learn patterns of drug-protein interactions. This allows them to predict which other proteins a drug is likely to interact with, beyond its intended target.\n",
      "    *   **Benefit:** This helps in identifying potential side effects early and can guide medicinal chemists to modify the molecule to improve its specificity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Advantages of AI in This Area:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** AI can perform these predictions in minutes or hours, compared to weeks or months for experimental assays.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Reducing the number of experimental failures saves enormous amounts of money.\n",
      "*   **Data-Driven Insights:** AI can uncover complex relationships in data that might not be obvious to human researchers.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Animal Testing:** By predicting toxicity and efficacy with greater accuracy upfront, AI can potentially reduce the reliance on animal models in early-stage research.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI is acting as a highly intelligent and rapid screening tool, providing crucial insights into a drug candidate's potential to succeed or fail long before it enters costly clinical trials. This dramatically increases the efficiency and success rate of drug development pipelines.\n",

    "In this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n",

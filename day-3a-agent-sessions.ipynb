    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "\n",
      "However, I can tell you about some of the **major ongoing trends and recent breakthroughs** that are shaping AI in healthcare right now:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Areas of Advancement and News:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Discovery and Development:** This is a huge area. AI is dramatically speeding up the identification of potential drug candidates, predicting their efficacy, and even designing novel molecules.\n",
      "    *   **Recent News Focus:** Companies are announcing successful preclinical trials or faster development timelines for AI-discovered drugs, particularly in areas like oncology, rare diseases, and infectious diseases. There's also a lot of buzz around AI's ability to repurpose existing drugs for new conditions.\n",
      "*   **Diagnostic Imaging:** AI algorithms are becoming increasingly sophisticated at analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides) to detect diseases earlier and more accurately than humans in some cases.\n",
      "    *   **Recent News Focus:** Approvals by regulatory bodies (like the FDA) for AI-powered diagnostic tools are becoming more common. News often highlights AI's ability to flag subtle anomalies, reduce radiologist workload, and improve diagnostic consistency. Areas like diabetic retinopathy, lung nodules, and breast cancer screening are seeing significant AI integration.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine and Treatment:** AI is crucial for analyzing vast amounts of patient data (genomics, lifestyle, medical history) to tailor treatment plans for individuals.\n",
      "    *   **Recent News Focus:** Advancements in using AI to predict patient response to specific therapies, optimize dosages, and identify individuals at higher risk for certain conditions are frequently reported.\n",
      "*   **Virtual Assistants and Chatbots:** AI-powered tools are being used to improve patient engagement, provide health information, schedule appointments, and even offer mental health support.\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas where AI is making a profound impact. Here are some of the key new developments and ongoing trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Major Developments and Trends in AI-Powered Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** AI algorithms can sift through massive datasets (genomic, proteomic, scientific literature) to identify novel biological targets implicated in diseases. They can also predict the \"druggability\" of these targets.\n",
      "    *   **Recent Focus:** AI is helping researchers find targets for previously \"undruggable\" diseases or identify new therapeutic approaches for complex conditions like neurodegenerative disorders and rare genetic diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **De Novo Drug Design (Designing New Molecules from Scratch):**\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** Generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) can design entirely new molecular structures with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, low toxicity, good pharmacokinetic profiles).\n",
      "    *   **Recent Focus:** Companies are reporting the successful synthesis and preclinical testing of AI-designed drug candidates. This capability is dramatically shortening the time it takes to move from target identification to a viable lead compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** Machine learning models can predict how well a potential drug will work and what side effects it might have, often before expensive and time-consuming lab experiments or clinical trials. This includes predicting ADMET properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity).\n",
      "    *   **Recent Focus:** Improved accuracy in predicting clinical trial outcomes and identifying potential safety issues early on. This helps researchers prioritize the most promising drug candidates and de-prioritize those likely to fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** AI can analyze drug databases and disease pathways to identify existing approved drugs that might be effective against new diseases.\n",
      "    *   **Recent Focus:** This is a particularly active area due to its potential for faster development and lower regulatory hurdles. AI is identifying new uses for drugs in areas like cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Optimizing Clinical Trial Design:**\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** AI can analyze historical clinical trial data to identify optimal patient populations, predict patient recruitment rates, and even design more efficient trial protocols.\n",
      "    *   **Recent Focus:** Reducing the cost and time of clinical trials, which are often the biggest bottleneck in drug development. AI is also being used to identify biomarkers that can predict a patient's response to a particular drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Accelerated Synthesis and Manufacturing:**\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** AI can optimize chemical synthesis routes, predict reaction outcomes, and even guide automated lab equipment for faster and more efficient drug production.\n",
      "    *   **Recent Focus:** Streamlining the lab-based synthesis of complex molecules designed by AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Examples of Recent News/Trends to Look For:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Partnerships:** Pharmaceutical giants are forming significant partnerships with AI drug discovery startups (e.g., Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI).\n",
      "*   **FDA Approvals:** While rare for entirely AI-discovered drugs so far, AI is increasingly playing a role in the preclinical stages leading to FDA submissions.\n",
      "*   **Specific Disease Areas:** Expect to see AI-driven progress in areas like:\n",
      "    *   **Oncology:** Finding new cancer targets and therapies.\n",
      "    *   **Neuroscience:** Tackling Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other brain disorders.\n",
      "    *   **Infectious Diseases:** Developing new antivirals and antibiotics.\n",
      "    *   **Rare Diseases:** Identifying treatments for conditions with small patient populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges Remain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these advances, challenges persist, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Quality and Access:** AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on.\n",
      "*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model predicts something can be difficult.\n",
      "*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** Ensuring AI-designed drugs meet stringent safety and efficacy standards.\n",
      "*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AI is not just a theoretical tool in drug discovery anymore; it's actively being used to identify targets, design molecules, and predict outcomes, leading to a faster, more efficient, and potentially more successful drug development pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which was **De Novo Drug Design (Designing New Molecules from Scratch)**. This is a truly revolutionary aspect of AI in drug discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate on what it is and why it's so significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery involved:\n",
      "1.  **Screening:** Testing thousands or millions of existing compounds against a biological target to see if any bind.\n",
      "2.  **Lead Optimization:** Taking a promising compound and making small chemical modifications to improve its properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**De Novo design** flips this on its head. Instead of searching through existing libraries, AI algorithms are designed to **create entirely new molecular structures** that are predicted to have specific desirable properties. It's like asking an AI architect to design a key from scratch that will perfectly fit a unique lock (the biological target), rather than trying to find a key that already exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Does AI Achieve This?**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is primarily done using **Generative AI models**. Think of them as AI systems that can \"create\" new content, much like AI art generators create images or AI text generators create stories. In drug discovery, these models are trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the \"rules\" of chemistry and molecular behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common types of generative models used include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks – a \"generator\" that proposes new molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to tell if they are real or fake. Through this \"adversarial\" process, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic and useful molecules.\n",
      "*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecules and then can decode points from this space to generate new ones.\n",
      "*   **Reinforcement Learning:** AI agents can be trained to \"explore\" chemical space and learn to design molecules that score highly on desired properties, guided by reward signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What Makes De Novo Design So Powerful?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Accessing \"Undiscovered\" Chemical Space:** The vast majority of possible drug-like molecules have never been synthesized or tested. De novo design allows researchers to explore this uncharted territory, potentially finding entirely novel therapeutic agents that wouldn't be found through traditional screening.\n",
      "2.  **Tailoring Molecules to Specific Needs:** Instead of just finding a molecule that *might* work, AI can be instructed to design molecules with a precise set of characteristics:\n",
      "    *   **High Affinity:** Strong binding to the target protein.\n",
      "    *   **Selectivity:** Binding only to the intended target, minimizing off-target effects.\n",
      "    *   **Good Pharmacokinetics (ADMET):** Ensuring the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted appropriately, and has low toxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Synthesizability:** Designing molecules that are actually feasible to create in the lab.\n",
      "3.  **Speed:** Generative AI can propose many promising candidate molecules in a fraction of the time it would take to screen existing libraries. This significantly shortens the early stages of drug discovery.\n",
      "4.  **Novelty:** It can lead to completely new classes of drugs with innovative mechanisms of action, which is crucial for tackling diseases where existing treatments are ineffective or resistance has developed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recent Developments and Examples:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Companies like Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals** are heavily invested in de novo design. They regularly announce their AI-designed molecules moving into preclinical testing.\n",
      "*   **Specific successes:** For instance, AI has been used to design inhibitors for challenging protein-protein interactions or to create molecules that can cross the blood-brain barrier for neurological conditions.\n",
      "*   **Integration with Synthesis:** The next frontier is seamlessly integrating de novo design with automated synthesis platforms, creating a fully automated \"design-make-test-analyze\" loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, de novo drug design using AI is transforming drug discovery from a process of searching to a process of intelligent creation, opening up unprecedented possibilities for developing new medicines.**\n",
      "\n",

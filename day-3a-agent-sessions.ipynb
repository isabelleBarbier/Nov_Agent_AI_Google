    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > What is the latest news about AI in healthcare?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The field of AI in healthcare is rapidly evolving, with new developments happening constantly. To give you the most up-to-date information, I'll highlight some of the key areas seeing significant progress:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Diagnostics and Imaging:**\n",
      "*   **AI is becoming increasingly adept at analyzing medical images** like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and pathology slides. It can help radiologists and pathologists detect subtle abnormalities that might be missed by the human eye, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of conditions like cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "*   **New algorithms are being developed for predictive diagnostics**, aiming to identify individuals at high risk for certain diseases even before symptoms appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "*   **AI is accelerating the process of identifying potential drug candidates** by analyzing vast datasets of biological and chemical information. This can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with traditional drug development.\n",
      "*   **AI is being used to design novel molecules** with specific therapeutic properties and to predict how drugs will interact with the human body.\n",
      "*   **Clinical trial optimization** is another area where AI is making strides, helping to identify suitable patients for trials and predict their outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Personalized Medicine and Treatment:**\n",
      "*   **AI analyzes patient data (genomics, lifestyle, medical history)** to tailor treatment plans to individual needs. This \"precision medicine\" approach aims to maximize treatment effectiveness and minimize side effects.\n",
      "*   **AI-powered tools are helping clinicians make better treatment decisions**, recommending the most appropriate therapies based on a patient's unique profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Administrative Tasks and Workflow Optimization:**\n",
      "*   **AI is automating many administrative burdens** in healthcare, such as scheduling appointments, managing patient records, and processing insurance claims. This frees up healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care.\n",
      "*   **AI-powered chatbots are being used for patient triage and answering common health questions**, improving accessibility and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Wearable Technology and Remote Monitoring:**\n",
      "*   **AI is integral to analyzing data from wearable devices** (smartwatches, fitness trackers) to monitor vital signs, detect anomalies, and provide early warnings for potential health issues.\n",
      "*   **Remote patient monitoring systems** powered by AI allow for continuous observation of patients with chronic conditions, enabling timely interventions and reducing hospital readmissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Generative AI in Healthcare:**\n",
      "*   **Generative AI models are showing promise in creating synthetic medical data** for training AI models, which can be particularly useful when real-world data is scarce or sensitive.\n",
      "*   **They are also being explored for generating medical reports, summarizing patient histories, and even assisting in medical education.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recent Trends and Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Increased focus on explainability and interpretability:** As AI becomes more deeply integrated into clinical decision-making, there's a growing demand for AI systems that can explain their reasoning, fostering trust among clinicians and patients.\n",
      "*   **Addressing bias and ensuring equity:** A significant challenge is ensuring that AI models are not trained on biased data that could lead to disparities in care for certain demographic groups.\n",
      "*   **Regulatory frameworks are evolving:** Governments and regulatory bodies are working to establish guidelines for the safe and effective deployment of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "*   **Data privacy and security remain paramount:** Protecting sensitive patient information is a critical concern as AI systems handle vast amounts of data.\n",
      "\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas where AI is making a significant impact. There are several new developments that are reshaping how we find and develop new medicines. Here are some key highlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n",
      "*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of sifting through existing compounds, generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) can now design entirely novel molecules from scratch that are optimized for specific targets and properties. This means creating molecules that have never been seen before but are predicted to be effective and safe.\n",
      "*   **\"Dreaming Up\" New Drugs:** Researchers are using AI to \"dream up\" molecules with desired characteristics, such as binding strongly to a specific protein, having a good pharmacokinetic profile (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug), and minimizing off-target effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Accelerating Target Identification:**\n",
      "*   **Uncovering New Disease Mechanisms:** AI is being used to analyze vast amounts of 'omics data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) and patient records to identify novel biological targets implicated in diseases. This helps researchers understand the root causes of illnesses and pinpoint where to focus their drug development efforts.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models can assess whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning whether a molecule can effectively bind to and modulate its activity. This saves time and resources by prioritizing targets that have a higher likelihood of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Enhancing Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n",
      "*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI can predict how well a drug candidate will work and its potential side effects *in silico* (using computer simulations) before expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments. This allows for earlier elimination of compounds with poor prospects.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Chemical Synthesis Routes:** AI can help design the most efficient and cost-effective chemical synthesis pathways to produce drug candidates, further streamlining the process.\n",
      "*   **Virtual Screening at Scale:** AI-powered platforms can screen millions of compounds against a target much faster than traditional methods, identifying promising leads.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Analysis:**\n",
      "*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more successful and efficient clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models can analyze historical clinical trial data to predict the likelihood of success for new trials, helping pharmaceutical companies make more informed decisions about which drugs to advance.\n",
      "*   **Real-World Evidence Integration:** AI is crucial for analyzing real-world data (from electronic health records, wearables, etc.) to understand drug effectiveness and safety in broader patient populations beyond controlled clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Specific Examples and Areas of Focus:**\n",
      "*   **AI for Antibiotic Discovery:** With the rise of antibiotic resistance, AI is being heavily used to find novel classes of antibiotics. Recent successes include identifying compounds that can kill bacteria resistant to existing drugs.\n",
      "*   **AI in Oncology:** AI is particularly active in cancer drug discovery, helping to identify new cancer targets, design personalized cancer therapies, and predict patient response to immunotherapy.\n",
      "*   **AI for Rare Diseases:** AI's ability to find patterns in limited datasets is proving valuable in the search for treatments for rare genetic diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Players and Trends:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AI-Native Biotech Companies:** A wave of startups and established biotechs are leveraging AI as their core technology for drug discovery (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, Schrödinger).\n",
      "*   **Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly forming partnerships with AI-driven biotech firms to access their platforms and expertise.\n",
      "*   **Focus on Speed and Efficiency:** The overarching trend is to dramatically reduce the time and cost traditionally associated with bringing a new drug to market, which can take over a decade and cost billions of dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "While AI is a powerful tool, it's important to remember that it's still a collaborative effort. AI complements the expertise of medicinal chemists, biologists, and clinicians, accelerating their work rather than replacing them entirely. The future of drug discovery is undoubtedly intertwined with AI.\n",
      "\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **Accelerating Target Identification**. This is a crucial early step in drug discovery, and AI is making significant strides here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down what \"target identification\" means and how AI is transforming it:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a Drug Target?**\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, a **drug target** is a specific molecule in the body (usually a protein or gene) that a drug is designed to interact with. This interaction is intended to alter the course of a disease. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cancer:** A target might be a protein that helps cancer cells grow uncontrollably. A drug would be designed to block this protein.\n",
      "*   **Infectious Diseases:** A target could be an enzyme essential for a virus or bacteria to replicate. A drug would inhibit this enzyme.\n",
      "*   **Cardiovascular Disease:** A target might be a receptor on blood vessel cells that, when activated by a drug, helps to relax the vessels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, identifying good drug targets was a painstaking process. It involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Deep understanding of disease biology:** Researchers had to meticulously study how diseases work at a cellular and molecular level.\n",
      "*   **Hypothesis-driven research:** Often, scientists would form hypotheses based on existing knowledge and then conduct experiments to prove or disprove them.\n",
      "*   **Limited data analysis capabilities:** It was incredibly difficult to sift through and connect the dots across the vast and ever-growing amount of biological data being generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Accelerating Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns in massive, complex datasets. This is where it revolutionizes target identification:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** This refers to analyzing various types of biological data together:\n",
      "        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences, genetic variations.\n",
      "        *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA expression levels (which genes are active).\n",
      "        *   **Proteomics:** Protein levels and their modifications.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolomics:** Levels of small molecules (metabolites) in the body.\n",
      "    *   **How AI helps:** AI algorithms can integrate and analyze these disparate datasets simultaneously. They can identify subtle correlations between specific genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways and a particular disease state that might be invisible to human researchers. For example, AI might find that a specific combination of gene expression changes and protein alterations is highly predictive of a disease's onset.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "    *   **Beyond the Obvious:** AI can help move beyond known disease pathways and uncover entirely new biological mechanisms that contribute to illness. This is crucial for diseases where our understanding is limited or where existing treatments are ineffective.\n",
      "    *   **Network Biology:** AI can map out complex biological networks and identify \"bottlenecks\" or key nodes within these networks that, if targeted, could have a significant therapeutic effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Leveraging Patient Data (Real-World Evidence):**\n",
      "    *   **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** AI can analyze anonymized EHRs to find patterns in patient populations. For instance, it might identify a correlation between a certain genetic marker and the development of a specific side effect from a known drug, hinting at a potential new target related to that pathway.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Trial Data:** Analyzing data from past clinical trials can reveal why certain drugs worked in some patients but not others, pointing to different underlying biological mechanisms and potential targets for new therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n",
      "    *   **Not all targets are created equal:** Once a potential target is identified, the next question is: can we actually design a drug to interact with it effectively?\n",
      "    *   **AI's role:** AI models can be trained on known successful and unsuccessful drug-target interactions. They can then predict the likelihood that a newly identified target can be modulated by a small molecule or biologic drug, based on its structural characteristics and known biological context. This helps prioritize targets that are more likely to lead to a viable drug.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact of AI in Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** AI significantly reduces the time it takes to move from broad biological data to a list of promising drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Breadth:** It allows researchers to explore a wider range of biological possibilities, including complex interactions and novel pathways.\n",
      "*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** AI moves target selection from a more intuition-based process to a rigorously data-driven one, increasing the probability of success.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine:** By identifying targets specific to certain patient subgroups, AI facilitates the development of more personalized and effective treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI acts as an incredibly powerful pattern-recognition engine that can make sense of the overwhelming complexity of biological systems, pinpointing the most promising points of intervention for new medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",

    "**Why This Example?**\n",

    "\n",
    "- Is introduced once but referenced multiple times\n",
    "- Should persist throughout a conversation\n",
    "- Represents a user-specific characteristic that enhances personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, for demo purposes, we'll create two tools that can store and retrieve user name and country from the Session State. **Note that all tools have access to the `ToolContext` object.** You don't have to create separate tools for each piece of information you want to share. "

# Welcome to the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google and Kaggle!

November 9, 2025.

## How the Course Works

The course is designed to be flexible and interactive, allowing you to learn at your own pace while benefiting from live sessions and community engagement.

Daily Content Release: New assignments will be posted each day on this Kaggle course page - your primary source for all course materials.
Assignment Notifications (Fast Follow): Given the large number of participants, links to all assignment materials including whitepapers, codelabs and podcast episodes — will also be shared on the Kaggle Discord and sent via follow-up email shortly after being posted.
Support & Discussion: Join the discussion on our dedicated Discord channels to connect with other learners, ask questions, and get support from Google researchers and engineers who will be monitoring the channels throughout the week.
Daily Livestreams: Join Kanchana Patlolla and Anant Nawalgaria live each day starting Monday, November 10th at 11 AM PT / 8 PM CET / 12:30 AM IST on Kaggle’s YouTube channel. They will be joined by special guests from Google, NVIDIA Cohere and more. After each session, recordings will be shared on Discord.
Course Completion: To get the most out of this intensive, we recommend completing all course materials including whitepapers, podcasts and codelabs before starting the capstone project.
[Optional] Capstone Project: On the final day, you’ll have the chance to apply everything you’ve learned by building your own AI agent. By participating in the capstone project, you will earn a badge on Kaggle.
